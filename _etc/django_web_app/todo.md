time series (decomposition & stationarity) 
    --> feature selection (tsfresh) 
    --> arima (evaluate/correlelogram), etc.

ARIMA todo:
mean; stdev; nobs
stationarity
white noise

When an ARIMA model includes other time series as input variables, the model is sometimes referred to as an ARIMAX model. Pankratz (1991) refers to the ARIMAX model as dynamic regression.
--The autocorrelation plot shows how values of the series are correlated with past values of the series.
--Data points are often non-stationary or have means, variances, and covariances that change over time.
nonstationary datasets need to be transformed into sattionary ones via differencing
