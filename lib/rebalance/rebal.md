by tax efficiency
    deploy new funds deposited
    raise capital through liquidating securities
    tax loss harvesting
    capital gains (equities) v. earned income (bonds)

-- we can make informed decisions as to which action is most optimal at each step --

--
replace with highly correlated asset after harvestinng tax loss
the harvest is really a deferal bc it lowers cost basis

locating the
tax-inefficient assets in a tax-deferred - this defferal enables compounding and deferal to lower tax rate if sold as long term gains
account, the investor can move the
efficient frontierâ€”and create the TaxEfficient Frontier.
taxable bonds < tax efficiency > equity


taxable as ordinary income or short term capital gains or extreme growth position --> tax advantaged (deferred) account
municiple bonds --> 
Because the advantages of
tax-free compounding may take time to
materialize, 

It rarely makes sense to put a client
into a qualified account if he does not
plan to hold the asset long enough to
get the advantage of tax deferral.

would take before each asset class
would break even and then perform
better in a tax-deferred account.
